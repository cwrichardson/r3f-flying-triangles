# GLBs
A good source of GLBs is [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/). You can try searching for "Smithsonian" to get some good public domain ones.

# Compression
Once you've downloaded a GLB, you can optimize it at [GLTF](https://gltf.report). Drag the files there (not entirely sure which ones you need, but the textures folder the `.bin` and the `.gltf` are what I've been using).

Then, open the "scripts" sidebar ("< >"), and there should be a popout with a "Run" button. Press that button.

When it's done, in the "Settings" menu, select "Draco" for compression (leave the settings as method: Edgebreaker; quantize: Mesh), and then click "Export".
